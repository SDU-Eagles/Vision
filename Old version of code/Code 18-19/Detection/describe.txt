FIRST METHOD WITH FINDCONTOURS.

Convert the video in grayscale. Blur it with gaussianBlur function, and then with canny edge detector we detect the edges of the image. After this, with findContours we take a list of contoured regions in the video. Then, for all the contours, we loop each time and we apply contour approximation. If the approximation contour is close to a rectangular, we compute the bounding box of the contour and take the aspect ratio of it by this type: (width/height). After this, we measure the solidity of the bounding box, and set some thresholds for aspect ratio between 0.8 and 1.2, in order to be approximately square. If all that are ok, we draw the bounding box and the center of it. After the detection of the marker we are going to use tesseract-ocr for the recognision of the letter inside.

SECOND METHOD WITH BLOB DETECTION.

1st step is to get the video from our camera/source and resize it so it an be easier to work with. Next step is to convert it into Grayscale. We now have a sequence of frames so it's like processing multiple images. When we are from high distance its easier to identify the marker from the background so we use the SimpleBlob detector from Opencv. We set the correct thresholds to "filter" the detection. 
To be done...
Next step is to extract the keypoints and and place a rectangle so we can remove the rest of the image 
Last step is to use some kind of ocr (like tesseract ) to extract the letter of the marker.
