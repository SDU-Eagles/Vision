# Vision
This is software for the SDU Eagles Vision System.
The objective is to search footage from the drone for markers placed on the ground.
When identified, the location, character and colour is reported back to the base station.

This repository does only include sample images, due to videos being larger in size. Add these videos in your cloned folder on your local device, the sample videos are in the 'SDU EAGLES' Google Drive in the folder 'Vision'. Git will when commiting ignore all .mp4 files.
