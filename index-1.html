<p>This is software for the SDU Eagles Vision System.
The objective is to search footage from the drone for markers placed on the ground.
When identified, the location, character and colour is reported back to the base station.</p>
<p>This repository does not include the sample videos, and will ignore any .mp4 files when committing. 
The sample videos you can find in the 'SDU EAGLES' Google Drive in the folder 'Vision'.</p>
